# AzCTF - 15 Challenges

Welcome to the AzCTF Challenge Repository!
This repository contains a variety of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges across multiple categories, designed to test and improve your skills in cybersecurity, reverse engineering, cryptography, forensics, OSINT, steganography, and web security.

This CTF was proudly introduced during the Az-SENCS Expo for the first time by Az-SENCS 15 Vice-President, Saleh Diaa Ahmed, as part of our initiative to promote hands-on cybersecurity experience within the student community.
