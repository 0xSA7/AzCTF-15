Here's what you should provide to challengers for this hard reverse engineering challenge:

**1. Challenge Files Package:**
```
AzCTF_reverse_challenge/
├── challenge          # Compiled binary (stripped of symbols)
├── README.md          # Challenge documentation
└── hint.txt           # (Optional) Progressive hint system
```

**2. README.md Contents:**

# AzCTF: Reverse Engineering Challenge (Hard)

## Challenge Description
Find the correct username/password combination to unlock the flag. The program uses cryptographic transformations to verify credentials.

**Difficulty**: Hard  
**Category**: Reverse Engineering  
**Flag Format**: `AzCTF{...}`

## How to Play
```bash
./challenge
# Enter 8-character username and password when prompted
```

## Hints (Available Separately)
1. Level 1: "The verification algorithm uses bitwise operations"
2. Level 2: "Focus on the transformation between user input and final verification value"
3. Level 3: "The magic number is 0x6d"
```

**3. Challenge Binary Preparation:**
Compile with security mitigations disabled and symbols stripped:
```bash
gcc -o challenge -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -s challenge.c
```

**4. Progressive Hint System:**
Release these through the CTF platform as time passes:
1. Initial Hint: "The program uses XOR transformations at multiple levels"
2. Intermediate Hint: "The final verification value must equal the XOR key used for flag encryption"
3. Final Hint: "Target verification value: 109 (0x6d in hex)"

**5. Validation Script (For CTF Platform):**
```python
#!/bin/python3
from pwn import *

def validate():
    p = process('./challenge')
    p.send(b"\x00"*8)  # Username
    p.send(b"\xfd" + b"\x00"*7)  # Password
    return b"AzCTF{" in p.recvall()

if validate():
    print("Solved!")
else:
    print("Keep trying!")
```

**6. Recommended Challenge Setup:**
1. Provide only the compiled binary (no source code)
2. Strip debug symbols to force static analysis
3. Use CTFd or similar platform with hint system
4. Add challenge tags: ["reverse", "xor", "crypto"]

**Key Challenge Elements:**
- Requires static analysis of binary to understand verification logic
- Needs understanding of XOR chaining operations
- Involves mathematical reverse engineering of checksum calculation
- Contains multiple layers of transformation to analyze

**What Participants Should Figure Out:**
1. Reverse engineer the verification algorithm
2. Discover the XOR-based flag decryption
3. Calculate required i2 value (109/0x6d)
4. Solve equation: Σ(password[i]^username[i] - i*4) = 109
5. Craft inputs that satisfy the verification equation

This setup creates a proper hard challenge that tests binary analysis skills, understanding of cryptographic transformations, and equation solving abilities.
