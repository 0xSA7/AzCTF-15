### ðŸ“‹ Manual Walkthrough (Wireshark):  

**Step 1:**  
Open `challenge.pcap` in Wireshark.  

**Step 2:**  
Filter for FTP traffic:  
```wireshark
ftp-data
```
or if thatâ€™s too noisy:
```wireshark
tcp.port == 20 || tcp.port == 21
```

**Step 3:**  
Look for TCP streams showing a suspicious file transfer.

- Right-click â†’ **Follow TCP Stream** on FTP-Data transfer.
- Save the stream contents **as raw binary**.

**Step 4:**  
If data looks strange (e.g., XORed), try simple XOR decoding with common patterns (`0x13`, `0x20`, etc.)

**Step 5:**  
Assemble the chunks, decode if necessary â†’ The file will contain the flag.
